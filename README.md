# My PyBadge!

This is a fork of Nina Zakharenko's PyBadge for PyCon. I basically customised a few items and i will be adding games to the menu!

Since the original code was made for PyBadge LC, i updated the libraries to suit the version of CircuitPython I'm using which is 5.2.

## CircuitPython and Libraries

### CircuitPython

This code targets CircuitPython version 5.0.0-beta.5. If you notice bugs or other issues with continued development, follow [these instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pybadge/installing-circuitpython) to upgrade your board to the [latest version](https://circuitpython.org/board/pybadge/).

### Libraries

This code depends on the [PyBadger](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PyBadger/) library. [Version 2.0.0](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PyBadger/tree/2.0.0) is included in the lib folder.

You may want to upgrade to the latest version. To upgrade your libraries, [download](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) the latest version for CircuitPython 5. Then, replace all the libraries in the `lib` folder from this bundle.

You may also want to read the [documentation](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/pybadger/en/latest/), or view the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PyBadger/).

## Editing the Code

I used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?WT.mc_id=pycon-github-ninaz) (an awesome IDE with [Python support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python?WT.mc_id=pycon-github-ninaz)) using the [Witch Hazel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheaFlowers.witch-hazel&WT.mc_id=pycon-github-ninaz) theme for the development of this code.
Follow these instructions for connecting to the serial port in the VS Code terminal to view printed output for [Mac/Linux](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/advanced-serial-console-on-mac-and-linux), and [Windows](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/advanced-serial-console-on-windows).

For programming hardware without an IDE [Mu](https://codewith.mu/) is a very simple text editor targeted for beginners.

## Contributions

This repository is meant to contain a snapshot of the code loaded on the badges at PyCon 2020. Minor fixes and version upgrades will be pushed, but new features will likely not be accepted.

If you made awesome modifications or added new features, please open an issue with a summary, a screenshot, and a link to your repository. Selected screenshots may be listed in a gallery in the future.
